## About Me  

I design and implement hybrid cloud ecosystems that combine data engineering, governance and automation across Azure and AWS.  

My work focuses on building secure, scalable and well-governed data platforms. I have experience in metadata management, access control, data classification, lineage and policy enforcement to support compliant and insight-ready environments.  

I bridge technical delivery with governance frameworks, helping organisations standardise data quality, modernise cloud infrastructure and enable responsible data use across the enterprise.
